 UntypedSharped is a compact micro-framework to bring untyped javascript features to the .NET world
 
 It started out as a fun experiment with implicit operators in C#, and evolved into this.

 A class representing the Javascript any type. (let the bullshittery commence)
 
 
 ## If (any)
 We can simulate falsy checking in Javascript in C# and .Net
